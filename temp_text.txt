My name is Finn Bludso's and I'm going to be talking about why I think react is way better and vanilla JavaScript. First off react is component base, which is allows for much better organization. It allows to basically Blends book JavaScript and HTML into one file, which is just very nice and it give you all sorts of different things like States like All sorts of cool things but I'm also going to argue why Swift is way better than JavaScript and that is because Swift all of Handler functions for handling states are gone. All you have to do is pass findings in just way better and I think of that Swift is ultimately way Superior to react.
